Question 1 – Normalization (Foundation)

You are given the following table used by a legacy application:

EmployeeSalesRaw
----------------------------------------------------
EmpId
EmpName
Department
Email
SaleMonth
SaleYear
SaleAmount


Tasks:

Identify normalization issues in the above table.

Normalize the structure up to 3NF.

Create appropriate tables with:

Primary keys

Foreign key relationships

Tables should at least include: Employee, Department, Sales.

Question 2 – ALTER TABLE (Business Change Request)

After reviewing Question 1, the business says:

“We want to track employee performance points.”

Tasks:

Use ALTER TABLE to add a column called BonusPoints to the Employee table.

Set default value as 0.

⚠️ This question depends on Question 1.

Question 3 – CHECK Constraint (Mid-Requirement Change)

Business rule update:

“Bonus points must always be between 0 and 100.”

Tasks:

Add a CHECK constraint on BonusPoints.

Ensure invalid values cannot be inserted or updated.

Question 4 – INNER JOIN (Mandatory)

Write a query to display:

Employee Name

Department Name

Sale Month

Sale Year

Sale Amount

Only include employees who have made at least one sale.

Use INNER JOIN only.

Question 5 – Date Function (Mandatory)

Write a query to calculate total sales for each employee for the current year.

Requirements:

Use SQL Server date functions

Do not hardcode the year

Question 6 – SUBSTRING and LEFT (Mandatory)

The business wants username suggestions.

Rule:

First 3 characters of employee name

First 2 characters of department name

Append employee ID

Example:

Marimuthu + IT + 101 → MarIT101


Tasks:

Generate the username using SUBSTRING and LEFT.

Display Employee Name and Generated Username.

Question 7 – Subquery (Mandatory)

Write a query to find employees whose total sales amount is greater than the average sales amount of all employees.

Rules:

Use a subquery

No joins in the outer query for calculation

Question 8 – UNION (Mandatory)

The business wants a consolidated report:

Employees who made sales above ₹50,000

Employees who made sales below ₹10,000

Tasks:

Write two separate SELECT queries.

Combine them using UNION.

Display: Employee Name, Sale Amount, Category (High / Low)

Question 9 – Trigger (Mandatory, Real-World Logic)

Business rule:

“Whenever a sale is inserted, automatically update BonusPoints.”

Rule:

If SaleAmount ≥ 50,000 → add 10 points

If SaleAmount ≥ 20,000 → add 5 points

Else → no bonus

Tasks:

Create an AFTER INSERT trigger on Sales table.

Ensure BonusPoints updates automatically.

Question 10 – Integrated Validation Query (Final)

Write a single query that shows:

Employee Name

Department

Total Sales

BonusPoints

Performance Grade

A → BonusPoints ≥ 50

B → BonusPoints between 20 and 49

C → Below 20

This question validates whether:

Normalization is correct

Trigger worked

Aggregations are correct

--------------------------------------

Question 2:


A training institute stores student course and marks data.
Initially, all data was stored in a single table.

Question 1 – Normalization (Mandatory)

Given the un-normalized table:

StudentCourseRaw
---------------------------------------
StudentId
StudentName
CourseName
TrainerName
CourseFee
JoiningDate
ExamMonth
ExamYear
Marks


Tasks:

Identify normalization issues.

Normalize the design up to 3NF.

Create required tables with:

Primary keys

Foreign keys

(Expected tables: Student, Course, Trainer, Exam / Marks)

Question 2 – ALTER TABLE (Schema Change)

Institute requirement:

“We want to store student reward points.”

Tasks:

Use ALTER TABLE to add RewardPoints column to Student table.

Set default value as 0.

(Depends on Question 1)

Question 3 – CHECK Constraint (Mandatory)

Rule:

“RewardPoints value must be between 0 and 100.”

Tasks:

Add a CHECK constraint.

Prevent invalid values.

Question 4 – INNER JOIN (Mandatory)

Write a query to display:

Student Name

Course Name

Trainer Name

Exam Month & Year

Marks

Show only students who have appeared for exams.
Use INNER JOIN.

Question 5 – Date Function (Mandatory)

Write a query to calculate total marks obtained by each student in the current year.

Rules:

Use SQL Server date functions

Do not hardcode the year

Question 6 – SUBSTRING and LEFT (Mandatory)

Institute wants to generate Student Login ID.

Rule:

First 3 letters of student name

First 2 letters of course name

Append student ID

Example:

Kumar + SQL + 105 → KumSQ105


Tasks:

Generate login ID using SUBSTRING and LEFT.

Display Student Name and Login ID.

Question 7 – Subquery (Mandatory)

Write a query to list students whose total marks are greater than the average marks of all students.

Rules:

Use a subquery

Do not calculate average in the outer query

Question 8 – UNION (Mandatory)

Institute wants a combined list:

Students who scored above 80 marks

Students who scored below 40 marks

Tasks:

Write two SELECT queries.

Combine using UNION.

Display:

Student Name

Marks

Category (HIGH, LOW)

Question 9 – Trigger (Mandatory)

Business rule:

“Whenever marks are inserted, update student RewardPoints.”

Rule:

Marks ≥ 80 → +10 points

Marks ≥ 60 → +5 points

Else → +2 points

Tasks:

Create an AFTER INSERT trigger on Marks table.

Automatically update RewardPoints.

Question 10 – COALESCE + Date Calculation (Mandatory)

Institute loyalty rule:

“If a student completes 3 years from JoiningDate, give ₹10,000 scholarship.”

Conditions:

Some students may not have exam records

RewardPoints may be NULL

Tasks:

Calculate scholarship amount:

Eligible → 10000

Not eligible → 0

Use COALESCE to handle NULL values.

Display:

Student Name

Joining Date

Years of Study

Scholarship Amount

Rules:

Use SQL Server date functions

No hard-coded dates
